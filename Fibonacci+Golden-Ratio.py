# ## The Fibonacci Numbers 
# 
# Fibonacci numbers are named after Italian mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, later known as Fibonacci. In his 1202 book 
# Liber Abaci, Fibonacci introduced the sequence to Western European mathematics,[5] although the sequence had been described 
# earlier in Indian mathematics,[6][7][8] as early as 200 BC in work by Pingala on enumerating possible patterns 
# of Sanskrit poetry formed from syllables of two lengths.
# 
# Fibonacci numbers appear unexpectedly often in mathematics, so much so that there is an entire journal dedicated to their 
# study, the Fibonacci Quarterly. Applications of Fibonacci numbers include computer algorithms such as the Fibonacci search
# technique and the Fibonacci heap data structure, and graphs called Fibonacci cubes used for interconnecting parallel and 
# distributed systems.
# They also appear in biological settings, such as branching in trees, the arrangement of leaves on a stem, the fruit sprouts 
# of a pineapple, the flowering of an artichoke, an uncurling fern, and the arrangement of a pine cone's bracts.
# 
# ## 'Fibonacci Spiral'
#     
# An approximation of the golden spiral created by drawing circular arcs connecting the opposite corners of squares in 
# the Fibonacci tiling; (see preceding image) Fibonacci numbers are strongly related to the golden ratio: Binet's 
# formula expresses the nth Fibonacci number in terms of n and the golden ratio, and implies that the ratio of two 
# consecutive Fibonacci numbers tends to the golden ratio as n increases.
# 
# A tiling with squares whose side lengths are successive Fibonacci numbers: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144....
